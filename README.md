# XYZ KPI Tracking Dashboard
![](kpi.jpg)
## Overview 
On this project, I worked on a bunch of datasets, to create a visually appealing dashboard where the company could track the performance/KPIs of one of its Online Marketing channels called Alibaba over the period they ran their paid performance campaign (20th March 2011 â€“ 5th April 2011), and also be able to perform desired cross analysis/ filters depending on a combination of several features of the campaign (i.e. target gender, target country, target device, etc.)  
## Key Insights 
* KPIs
* Ads Performance
* Website Performance
* Marketing Performance
* Sales Performance
* Customer Information 
## Tool Used
* Power BI
## Skills Demonstrated 
* Data Cleaning/Transformation
* Data Modelling
* Dax Querying
* Data Visualization
* Data Analysis
## Datasets
* Campaign_export.csv: List of campaign metrics by day from the export from the Alibaba main interface for paid performance ads.
* Transactions.csv: List of sales figures and customer info by transaction_ID.
* Website_tracking_checkout.csv: Information about the campaign, source, and medium that was tracked at checkout in the company website at transaction_ID level.
* Website_tracking_visits.csv: Information about the campaign, source, and medium that was tracked at the session level.
* Mapping_tables.xls: Table to help in understanding the campaign_name column in the datasets and also create the required slicers/filters.
The datasets can be found in the file section of this repository.
## Data Cleaning/Transformation 
The four .csv datasets were imported into Power BI via Power Query Editor, where I performed cleaning and transformation tasks utilizing Power Query and its built-in functions. Specifically, I split the campaign_name column in each dataset into separate columns, taking into account the information in the mapping_table.xls table.  
I also ensured proper formatting for all date columns and verified that each column had the correct data type. Since the focus is on transactions generated by ads, I created a new table containing only these transactions. This was achieved by joining data from the transaction table and website tracking checkout table.

## Data Modelling 
New tables were created using Dax functions this is to facilitate the creation of filters, allowing for more effective visualization and extraction of the desired information.  
After creating the tables I made sure to join them in the right relationship to the fact tables.  
To view in detail how these tables were created and Dax codes used click [here](Data_Modeling_Guide.pdf).
## Data Analysis
To get the required KPIs, I had to create measures, this I was able to do using the DAX functions.  
To view the codes used to create these measures, and KPI click [here](Data_Analysis_Guide.pdf).
## Data Visualization
After cleaning, modeling, and creating the necessary measures, I created a dashboard to view all the information extracted from the data and analysis.  
This dashboard consists of KPIs, Ads Performance, Website Performance, Marketing Performance, Sales Performance, and Customer Information.  
On this dashboard, we would be able to filter the data to suit the information we want to view.
